            <h3>Until Death Parts Us</h3>
            <p style="margin:2% 0;">Welcome to my shrine dedicated to the relationship between Tomoe Yukishiro and Kenshin Himura from Rurouni Kenshin, known as TomoKen (TMKN or also called BattoTomoe)! Their relationship is very dear to me (one of my first tattoos was dedicated to them) and I adore their dynamic and what it provides to the themes of Rurouni Kenshin.</p>

                            <p>Tomoe Yukishiro is the eldest daughter of the Yukishiro family, comprised of her father, a samurai, her mother, who would eventually pass after giving birth to her younger brother, Enishi Yukishiro. After her mother's passing, she would take on the roles of both sister and mother to Enishi, who likewise viewed her as such and revered her. Over time, she would grow to know Akira Kiyosato, who would soon become her fiancee. Even though she was an outwardly emotionless woman, she was happy to be loved by Akira. However, as tensions of the late Edo period swelled, Akira felt he needed to join the action in order to truly satisfy Tomoe. Unfortunately, he would be slain by the Ishin-shishi's shadow assassin, known as Hitokiri Battosai.</p>
                            <p>Upon receiving news of Akira's death, Tomoe felt at fault for his murder, and sought to seek revenge on his killer. She would join the Yaminobu and be sent out to locate and kill the infamous Hitokiri Battosai. After meeting him face-to-face after watching him slay another assassin, Tomoe would slip into the employment of Kohagi-ya, where many members of the Ishin-shishi resided. Over time, Tomoe lost sight of her mission and found herself falling in love with Battosai, whose name she would learn is Kenshin.</p>

                            <p>Shinta was born to parents who would die of cholera in his early youth, at which point he would find himself being the property of slave traders. After his troupe is attacked one night, he is barely saved by Hiko Seijiro XIII, the current master of the Hiten Mitsurugi style of swordsmanship. Hiko would take in Shinta and give him the name Kenshin. Afer training under Hiko for many years until his teens, Kenshin would feel he needed to act during the injustices of the Bakumatsu, leaving his training unfinished. Kenshin would end up in the Kihetai before being scouted by Katsura Kogoro to become a hitokiri. Kenshin would accept at the ripe age of only 14.</p>
                            <p>After slaying hundreds of men, Kenshin would face off against a man with more vigor and will to live than any other, leaving him with a single scar on his cheek, the first to ever harm him in a swordfight. Some days later, he would be seen by a woman while killing another assassin who had attacked him. After she had fainted, he would take her to his residence at Kohagi-ya, and due to their proximity (and maybe outside forces), would end up in a sort of budding relationship with her.</p>

                           <p>After the Ikedaya Incident, Kenshin and Tomoe would end up in an arrangement to live in a remote area of Otsu as farmers and medicine-sellers. The two would marry and enjoy months of this quiet life together. At some point, Tomoe's younger brother, Enishi, would make an appearance. He would reveal he had joined the Yaminobu in her footsteps to get revenge for Akira, who Enishi had seen as somewhat of an older brother, and call her to action. Tomoe begged Enishi to go back home, much to his chagrin, realizing his sister had fallen for the man who robbed her of her happiness. Shortly thereafter, Tomoe would leave Kenshin to settle things once and for all and free him from the fate she had resigned him to. Unbeknownst to her, she had been used to create a weakness for Kenshin so that he could be defeated. As Kenshin made his way through the forest to Tomoe, facing enemies that would weaken him along the way, he would face off against the leader of the Yaminobu. Just before fatal blows could be exchanged, Tomoe had come to her own decision that she would not let a man she loved die again. She would jump into the middle of the battle, attempting to slaughter the leader, but would fall victim to Kenshin's own blade instead. In her final moments, she would complete the cross shaped scar that became a symbol of a legend.

            <h3>Why TomoKen?</h3>
              <p>I couldn't really tell you.</p>
              <p>I repeat this all the time, but the most impactful reading of Rurouni Kenshin I completed was when I was about 12 and facing many, many different things in my life. The series became especially important to me during this time. The Remembrance and Jinchuu arcs (the TMKN arc and final arc of RK) became particularly engrained in my being, as I was probably finally old enough to grasp the themes of these stories (I had read and watched RK numerous times by this age, but the anime only went up to the end of the Kyoto Arc, and I probably had previously only skimmed over the latter two arcs).</p>
              <p>"Doomed" is a word that gets tossed out a lot in regards to shipping, but TMKN</p>

                        Take what is left of my life
                        Before you go
                        Show me what it's like to finally know
                        The face behind the silhouette
                        In this world I made to be infinite
                        But within the expanse, I finally see
                        A world without you isn't meant for me

                        Where do you go when I close my eyes?
                        What do you see looking back at me?
                        Am I just a ghost just like you?
                        Caught between the seams of two intertwining melodies
