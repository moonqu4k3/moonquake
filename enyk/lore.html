        <div class="title">A Life-changing Meeting</div>
        <details><summary>Yukie walked aimlessly around the harbor, among the crewmen and foreigners flooding the docks.</summary>
<p>"What a life it must be to be able to come and go as you please… not to mention the money that comes with it,” they said to themselves. After walking for a bit more, they stopped in their tracks. "Hold on a minute… I can do that…!” they realized, "If I can hide myself in crates outside a restaurant, waiting for them to close, why wouldn’t I be able to do the same on a ship!” Their sudden moment of clarity boosted their mood, and almost as if it was a sign from the heavens, they heard a foreman shouting "Over here! Bring those crates here, they’re going to Shanghai!” waving over to his crewmates.</p>
<p>"When the opportunity presents itself…”</p>
<p>They casually made their way over to the dock where the ship was sitting, taking a seat on some nearby barrels, and waiting for their opportunity to sneak aboard.</p>
<br>
<p>“I've seen farms with more security…” they said, walking down into the storage keep. It was packed tightly with crates of all sizes, many of them being quite substantial. </p>
<p>"These are pretty big containers for a small ship… not that any ship is ever really small…” they said, tracing one of the crates. They walked to the back corner of the room, finding a small spot on top of some crates, mostly hidden from the entryway. "I should be able to stay right here and not have to worry about getting caught…or getting crushed.”</p>
<p>They climbed up and nestled themselves in the corner, getting as comfortable as they could.</p>
<p>"I guess it wouldn’t hurt if I closed my eyes for a bit… it’s been a while since I had a closed space to sleep in…” they thought, closing their eyes and quickly dozing off.</p>
<br>
<p>A sudden jolt awakened them, causing them to hit their head on the ceiling upon getting up.</p>
<p>"Eh?” they remarked, "Something doesn’t feel right,” and it wasn’t just the newly formed knot on their head. What they expected to hear upon awakening was the great bustling of Shanghai. Certainly, they heard the yelling from the crew above them as they worked to dock the ship, but otherwise, it was a far cry from what they expected.</p>
<p>"Did I dream that the ship was going to Shanghai,” they questioned, "No… I'm definitely sure this was the one!” they hopped down from their spot, carefully walking around the storage keep, peering around before moving to their next spot. They heard a grinding noise to their left, turning their head to see what it was, being faced with a falling crate.</p>
<p>"Fuck…!” they exclaimed, quickly throwing themselves backward, falling into another crate in the process, knocking the lid off slightly. They lifted their hand upon noticing the top had moved, and, letting their curiosity get the best of them, looked inside at its contents. Suddenly, their eyes widened, and they took a step back, "What the hell is this…” they uttered. It was a large metal creation, far larger and likely heavier than any human should be able to carry. "Is it… some sort of cannon?” they wondered. Turning back around to the box that had nearly fallen onto them, it had all but smashed, leaving rounds of ammunition littering the floor.
<p>"What was that noise?” they heard someone say from above them.</p>
<p>"Shit…!” they exclaimed. Frantically looking around for a place to hide, they darted to their left in a tight out-cove between some crates.</p>
<p>"I know I heard a noise down here. Did something fall?”</p>
<p>"Over there, some of the ammo crates.”</p>
<p>"Shit… the boss isn’t gonna be too pleased about this.”</p>
<p>Yukie felt an itch under their nose, "Fuck…!? The gunpowder?! Hold it in, hold it in…!”</p>
<p>"Nothing else is damaged, right? It looks like generic bullets. It shouldn’t be too much of a problem to explain.”</p>
<p>"Let’s hope so…”</p>
<p>"Achoo…!”</p>
<p>The two men stopped in their tracks. "Fuck… I've really done it now…” they muttered, reaching to their left side for their makiri.
<p>"Show yourself!” one of the men called out, while the other made his way to where Yukie was hiding. Immediately before he reached them, Yukie jumped out first, brandishing their dagger, and startling the man. Using this moment to catch him off guard, they kicked him in the stomach, getting him to double over, grabbing his arms and pinning them behind him, holding the knife up to his throat.</p>
<p>"Take me to your boss right now, or you’ll have a bigger problem to explain,” they demanded. It was all a ruse, they had no intention of harming the poor guy any further, let alone with something as important to them as their makiri. Still, it was working, the other crewmate seemed apprehensive, backing away slightly. "Didn’t you hear me?” They repeated, "I said take me to your–” They were suddenly cut off by the presence of someone behind them, attempting to overtake them too. Quickly enough, they let the other man go, ducking out of the way of the second. Unfortunately, they ducked right into another crate, their momentary daze causing them to get them apprehended.
<p>"There were more down here…?!”</p>
<p>The first man walked back over to them, crouching down in front of them, "Not a problem, we’ll take you to the boss, alright.” the man leered.</p>
<p>"I have a feeling I've gotten myself involved in something I shouldn’t have…”</p>
<br>
<p>"Get the fuck off me!” they called out over and over, rocking the small boat they were taking to the shore.</p>
<p>"Keep moving around and you’ll be seeing your god before the boss,” the man said, "And you certainly won’t be taking this with you to your meeting,” he added, reaching for the makiri that was sitting on the bottom of the boat, dangling it in front of them.</p>
<p>"Put it down.” they ordered, suddenly putting out a much more threatening air. It got to the man, who apprehensively set it back down. The boat suddenly rocked harshly, then stopped, signaling their arrival on shore. Two men took hold of Yukie again, pulling them out of the boat as they fell into the water, desperately trying to get away and managing to get one arm free before a third man came to restrain them.</p>
<p>"You’re putting up more of a fight than you should be, you’re just making it harder on yourself,” the man said.</p>
<p>"Eat shit,” they spat out.</p>
<p>"What is going on over here?” a voice spoke. Yukie peered around their captors, searching for the source of the voice, assuming it to be this "Boss”. All they saw before them were four abnormally broad and tall men, with a much smaller – and not just by comparison – man dressed in black standing in the middle of them. Suddenly, they burst into laughter. Everyone in attendance turned to look at them, a reaction completely unbefitting of the situation.</p>
<p>"What…?!” the man in black seethed, "What is so funny…?!”</p>
<p>"You– you’re this “boss” everyone keeps talking about…?!” they got out in between breaths of laughter, "You gotta be kidding me…! This guy’s less threatening than a puppy!”</p>
<p>His face contorted in embarrassment and anger, "You…! You have the gall to try and humiliate me…?!” he yelled out, reaching for the gun in his shirt, and pointing it at Yukie.</p>
<p>"Woah…! Easy boy, I was just teasing. No need to brandish your fangs at me… not that it’s all that scary,” they quipped.</p>
<p>"You…!”</p>
<p>Enishi made his way over to the shore, greeting the foreman and confirming the shipment. He couldn’t ignore the commotion that was taking place not far from him, as much as he would’ve liked to. Passing the receipts back to the foreman, he decided to check in, albeit begrudgingly.</p>
<p>"Heixing, what’s going on over here?”</p>
<p>"Boss, as you can see, there was a rat on board,” he said, barely retaining his composure, and gesturing over to the person currently being restrained by four crewmen now. </p>
<p>"Get your hands off of me! I'll bite them off if I have to!” they yelled, kicking and struggling to break free. Upon hearing the word "Boss” uttered, though, they came out of their fit. </p>
<p>"Boss…? So, you’re the one in charge and not this oddly aging child?” they said, earning a lunge from Heixing, but Enishi put up his hand before anything further could commence. Enishi stared at the person in front of him, still slightly wiggling to try and break free.</p>
<p>"Who are you?” he interrogated.</p>
<p>"What’s it matter to you?” they shot back. </p>
<p>"How did you get aboard my ship?” he asked again.</p>
<p>"I dunno, pretty much waltzed right on. You’d think an illegal arms dealer might have better security,” Yukie noticed a twitch in Enishi’s eye, "Ooh, did I hit the mark?”</p>
<p>Enishi looked at them for a moment longer, saying, "Heixing, get rid of him,” before beginning to turn away until they caught his eye again. They were staring back at him with the most unfazed expression, not even bothered that his life was just ordered to be cut short. Enishi wanted to shake that look out of his mind, but it was difficult. Still, he walked off.</p>
<p>"Go ahead and kill me, I'll bet you’ll get knocked back by that pistol before the bullet even fires!” he heard them taunt. "Faced with death and they still continue to remain unbothered…” he thought to himself.</p>
<p>“I'll shoot your earrings off one by one the longer you keep running your mouth!” Heixing yelled out.</p>
<p>"Try it! I'll make you play fetch with them if I survive!” they returned.</p>
<p>"You certainly don’t often find someone willing to challenge the Shanghai mafia like that…” he continued to think. The image of their expression, completely unfaltering, kept reappearing in his mind. It was a face almost familiar to him, though he couldn’t pinpoint from where. Somehow, it was enough to make a pit form in his stomach. Suddenly, a gunshot rang clear through the open air. </p>
<p>"You missed,” Yukie remarked, though that was not necessarily the case. Enishi turned back around to see droplets of blood being absorbed into the sand, and a latent instinct in him kicked in as he stormed back over to the scene.</p>
<p>"Heixing. Don’t you dare make another move, or your blood will stain the sand next.” the man suddenly ordered.</p>
<p>"But boss–”, he uttered.</p>
<p>"Didn’t you hear me? Don’t. You. Move.”</p>
<p>Yukie thought they had caught a glimpse of something near the man’s eye, but they were still just far enough away that they couldn’t tell. Heixing backed away, and Enishi made his way forward, starting to get a better look at the situation. A small streak of blood trickled down their neck, but no discernable wounds, at least not that he could see right now.</p>
<p>Soon, he was standing before the stowaway again, saying to them, "What is it you want?”</p>
<p>"What?”</p>
<p>“I'll pay you to get back on this ship and go back to where you came from.”</p>
<p>"You’re asking a lot from me. I don’t exactly have a place to go back to.”</p>
<p>Enishi stood silently for a moment, shocked at their words. </p>
<p>“I'm doing you a favor here by sparing your life.”</p>
<p>"Are you really? Or do you just feel like you are?” Yukie called into question, "Did you ever stop to consider that maybe I had a motive for getting on your ship that didn’t involve sabotage? I could seriously care less about your business, all I heard was that this ship was going to Shanghai, and I finally saw that as my ticket out of that hellscape.”</p>
<p>Enishi recognized those words and feelings all too well, the hatred of Japan that made him leave as well. He couldn’t know their personal reasons behind it, but it developed the smallest bit of camaraderie.</p>
<p>"So, what? Do you want to go there instead?”</p>
<p>"Not anymore.”</p>
<p>“‘Not anymore?’” he repeated, “I'm trying to honor your requests.”</p>
<p>"The only thing you’re trying to do is protect your integrity.”</p>
<p>"Is this the same stubbornness that’s kept you alive thus far?”</p>
<p>"Now you’re starting to get it,” they quipped back. Pausing for a moment, they played their last card, "Let me stay here.”</p>
<p>"Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>"I don’t see what the problem would be. It won't be forever, just until I decide where I wanna go.”</p>
<p>"And I should let you reside here with nothing in return? I almost wish I'd never gone back on my order.”</p>
<p>"Not for nothing in return,” they said, "I can work for you.”</p>
<p>"Forget about it,” he said, "You’ll be leaving as soon as the cargo is unloaded. I'll drag you back on the ship personally if I have to.”</p>
<p>"It took four of your men to just barely hold me back, you think you’d be able to do it on your own?” Suddenly, Yukie twisted their arms free, jolting forward to stand in front of Enishi. The crewmen moved to grab them again, but Enishi put up his hand signaling to stay put.</p>
<p>“I'm not smart enough to help with your business, but I can cook a damn good meal. You don’t look like you eat all that well,” they added, looking at him up and down, "You can’t weigh much more than I do, which is saying something. I somehow doubt that you’re the type of guy who has a personal chef or anything like that.”</p>
<p>"My answer remains the same. You can try and plead all you want, just know it’s falling on deaf ears.”</p>
<p>"Do you know how to cook?” they pestered.</p>
<p>"What?”</p>
<p>"It’s a simple question, idiot. Can you even make anything worthwhile to eat?”</p>
<p>Enishi stayed silent, but Yukie continued, "I know I'm right, you really can’t. I'm perceptive with these kinds of things.” Yukie walked closer to Enishi, “I'll make a deal of my own: you let me stay here as your live-in servant, you don’t have to pay me, just give me a room, doesn’t have to be a nice one either, and access to the kitchen. If you’re worried about me leaking information about your business, I don’t know anyone, let alone even how to read or write.”</p>
<p>Enishi noticed another drop of blood fall to the ground below, something that they almost seemed unaware of, and it was making Enishi more and more sick to look at. Not being able to look at them any longer, he had no choice but to concede.</p>
<p>"Fine,” Enishi huffed, "But under one more condition: don’t bother me.” he enunciated.</p>
<p>"Deal,” Yukie agreed, "Now… how do you even get up there?” they said, gesturing up toward the mansion on the cliff. Without speaking, Enishi turned around and began walking. "Hey! Are you gonna tell me or not!?” Yukie yelled to him, huffing and pouting before running over to follow him, leaving all who witnessed their exchange in shock.</p>
<br>
<p>The two walked in silence up the rocky and uneven path to the mansion. "Hey, boss man, is this seriously where you live? And do you seriously not have a maid or anything like that? I was just saying things in hopes one of them would hit the mark, but you agreed to my totally bogus deal, so I have to be right… right?” they pestered, with Enishi still not answering. "Are you listening to me? And how much farther is it? Since you can’t cook, do you even have anything in your kitchen? I was too busy trying to plan my escape that I didn’t see if there were any fish in the cove, but I'm sure if I–” </p>
<p>Enishi suddenly cut them off, "Were you listening to me at all? The one and only rule I set was not to bother me, and you’re doing just that.”</p>
<p>“I'm doing you a favor! I'm offering— “</p>
<p>"No, I'm the one doing the favor here,” he reiterated, "I could’ve let Heixing do away with you and toss your body to the sharks.”</p>
<p>"But you didn’t,” they reminded him, "So why?”</p>
<p>Enishi stopped in his tracks for a moment, before casting a sharp glance back at them, "It’s not something I have to explain to you,” he continued walking again, leaving Yukie for a moment to try and process what he meant, before continuing as well.</p>
<p>"We’re here,” he announced shortly after.</p>
<p>It was a Western-style mansion with a yellowish-cream exterior and green accents. A large balcony stretched off of the west side. It wasn’t incredibly opulent like it had seemed from down on the shore, but it was still unlike anything Yukie had ever seen.</p>
<p>"Are you just going to stand there and gawk or are you ever going to take care of that blood on you?” Enishi barked, interrupting said gawking, which is exactly what they were doing.</p>
<p>"Blood?” they questioned, raising their hand to their face and feeling for a wound, eventually figuring out what he was talking about when they saw their fingertips stained with red after touching their right ear.</p>
<p>"Did they seriously have no clue?” Enishi thought to himself. "I missed what happened for them to bleed like that, but still… to not even be aware of it? What’s up with this person?” he pondered, certainly being the last person to question others like that. "Go wash yourself off, I'll get you bandages if you need them.”</p>
<p>“I'll be fine, just show me where the kitchen is,” Yukie said. Enishi looked at them with prying eyes, but knowing he wasn’t going to but knowing he wasn’t going to find out anything further. "It’s straight back,” he answered shortly.</p>
<br>
<p>Yukie grabbed a knife from the block, using it as a makeshift mirror, "It doesn’t look like it’s ever been used…” they thought aloud. Tilting the knife to see their ear, they pushed their hair aside, strands stuck together with dried blood. "Aah, so that’s what happened…” a chunk of their ear had been shot off, along with whatever hair had been in the way, making their already uneven and disheveled haircut even more so.</p>
<p>"Any further left and my entire ear probably would’ve been blown off, or at least enough to cause some damage,” they spoke as if they weren’t now missing the outer cartilage of their ear.</p>
<p>"Better look for a washcloth or something…” they mumbled, rooting around through drawers until they happened upon a small hand towel. "Hope he wasn’t attached to this,” they said, soaking it before beginning to wipe the blood off their face, hair, and clothes. Enishi watched silently from around the corner, his face contorting as he desperately tried to make out the character of his new housemate. Suddenly, he tossed a roll of bandages onto the counter.</p>
<p>"Here. Use those,” he spoke harshly. Yukie whipped around to face him, "Ah, don’t worry about it! It’s stopped bleeding already!” they exclaimed as they pushed their hair out of the way to reveal their gnarled ear. Enishi quickly turned away, attempting to contain the disgust he felt rising in his gut.</p>
<p>"Why is it that I can’t bear to look at them?”</p>
<p>Yukie looked on at him in confusion as he stumbled away without a word. </p>
<p>"What a confusing man…” they set the blood-stained cloth onto the counter and walked out into the opulent mansion. It was decorating with a mix of Chinese and Western furniture, creating the atmosphere that they were in a brand new country. Granted, they didn’t know where they were in the world, but nothing they could see reminded them of Japan. “It might not end up being so bad here afterall,” they thought. Taking a seat on a less comfortable than it looked lounge chair, they laid back, enjoying a level of silence and safety they thought they’d never experience again.</p>

          <div class="title">New Clothes</div>
          <details><summary>Enishi tossed the neatly tied package onto Yukie’s bed, "For you,” he said, shortly. Yukie stared back at him, puzzled, "What is it?”</summary>
            <p>"Just open it.”</p>
<p>Yukie still stared at Enishi, refusing to touch the package, "Do you really have to watch me open it?”</p>
<p>"I need to know if I have to send it back.”</p>
<p>"Send it back? The hell did you get me?”</p>
<p>"Open it or that’ll be the last time I get you anything,” he huffed.</p>
<p>"It’s not like I asked you to do this in the first place…” Yukie grumbled, finally untying the knot of the gift. Slowly unfolding it, they were stunned to see each pattern that was revealed. Holding up the first item, it was a beautiful deep purple cheongsam, adorned with gold threading along the collar, a subtle floral pattern covering the fabric. "You didn’t have to–” Yukie started, before being cut off by Enishi.</p>
<p>"I couldn’t stand seeing you in that ratty robe anymore, it’s a wonder it’s still holding up.” Yukie looked down at the clothes they were wearing. As rude as his statement was, it was true, the hem of their robe was obviously fraying and was discolored as a whole; no matter how intently they washed it every day, it had long since served its purpose. It held far too many memories that they didn’t need to be reminded of.</p>
<p>"If you don’t like that one, there’s a few more,” Enishi said, turning around to walk out of their room. "Try them on and I'll send back whatever you don’t like,” he implored, shutting the door behind him. Yukie continued looking through the clothes, the second one being a set of a cream-colored changshan shirt and black pants, not unlike Enishi’s. The third was another set, this one featuring a more feminine cheongsam-style shirt. The final item at the bottom was much more familiar: a Japanese yukata. It was a dark blue, decorated with purple, pink, and blue morning glories, and a crimson sash that seemingly went with it. They laid out each garment on their bed and began trying them on.</p>
<p>A knock at the door startled them slightly, accompanied by a voice, “I'm coming in.”</p>
<p>"Wait a minute!” Yukie urged, desperately trying to fasten the last clasp on their shirt. After a few seconds they said, "Alright, you can open the door.” Enishi entered apprehensively, seeing Yukie still fiddling with the closure. They were wearing the changshan, with Enishi admitting, "It looks nice on you,” hoping Yukie wouldn’t notice the slight blush that crept onto his cheek.</p>
<p>"You think? It’s really comfortable… it’s the same type of shirt you wear, right?”</p>
<p>"Hm? Yeah, it is… why?”</p>
<p>"I was just curious,” they snapped. Ignoring their shortness, he asked, "Did you try on the other ones yet?”</p>
<p>"Yeah, they’re nice… I think the dress is too tight on me though.”</p>
<p>Innocently, he asked, "Can I see it?”</p>
<p>"Pervert.” they shot back.</p>
<p>"That’s not what I meant. The dress itself,” he said, obviously ticked off. He moved over to their bed to pick up the cheongsam, holding it up next to Yukie and glancing between them and the dress.</p>
<p>"I should kill you for eyeing me up like that,” they snarled.</p>
<p>"That’s the last thing I want to do. You can tell me your measurements instead then.”</p>
<p>"Pervert,” they repeated.</p>
<p>"You’re annoying,” he spat out, "Don’t expect me to do something like this again,” he retorted, setting the cheongsam back down on the bed before walking out and shutting the door behind him.</p>
<p>"I told you. I didn’t ask you to do this in the first place…” they said aloud, hoping he could hear them.</p>
<br>
<p>Enishi walked back inside the mansion, tired and hungry from training, and decided to drop in on the kitchen, only to see Yukie already preparing dinner. </p>
<p>"That’s the one you decided to wear?” he exclaimed, noticing Yukie jump slightly.</p>
<p>"Don’t sneak up on me like that, I have a knife,” they warned, "And what’s with the tone? You picked it out thinking I would like it, and I do.”</p>
<p>Enishi looked vaguely annoyed, "It was just an afterthought. I saw it and figured I should get Japanese-style clothes too.”
<p>"Huh? It wasn’t ‘cause of the morning glories?” they questioned.</p>
<p>"Why would it be?” They both paused for a minute, before Yukie looked away, going back to chopping, "Never mind…” they said. Enishi stared at them, completely puzzled. He walked over to them, peering around to face them, "Do you like morning glories?”</p>
<p>"I warned you! I have a knife!” they shouted, getting flustered at the sudden closeness. "What does it matter to you, anyways?” they pouted.</p>
<p>"Because I don’t know anything about you.”</p>
<p>"Hah? Aren’t you the one who’s been trying to convince me not to get close to you?”</p>
<p>"Clearly my attempts haven’t been working.”</p>
<p>"So, you’re just gonna throw all caution to the wind now?”</p>
<p>He shrugged, "Might as well. Maybe you’ll be less inclined to poison my food that way.”</p>
<p>Yukie stared at him, perplexed, "I don’t get you at all,” they scoffed, "Never in my life have I met someone who’ll admit he’s killed people, and then the next week ask me my favorite flower.”</p>
<p>"So, they are your favorite?”</p>
<p>"Eh?!” they exclaimed, "I guess… there just used to be a lot of them around where I grew up.”</p>
<p>Enishi hummed in acknowledgment, moving his gaze to the cutting board Yukie was working at. Their hands moved quickly with the knife but still sliced the radishes into perfectly even slices. He remembered how Tomoe had the same knack for cooking.</p>
<p>"What are you c–”</p>
<p>"Get out.” Yukie snapped, pointing the knife just inches away from Enishi’s face, "Or poisoning won’t be the only thing you’ll have to worry about.”</p>
<p><p>Enishi carefully backed up and out of the kitchen. "Ah,” he thought to himself, "I should’ve asked where they were from…”  he looked over his shoulder to Yukie, angrily throwing ingredients into a pot. "Yu–”</p>
<p>They slowly turned their head around, "Enishi…” they leered, "Didn’t I tell you? Bother me again and you’ll find out what else this knife is good for.”</p>
<p>"Scary. Truly nothing like my sister.”</p>

          <div class="title">Twilight</div>
          <details><summary>Wake up, cook, clean, walk, cook, clean, talk, cook, clean, sleep.</summary>
            <p>Every day had more or less followed that pattern. It wasn’t hard work by any means, in fact, it could be quite enjoyable at times. Breaks in the schedule were a breath of fresh air, like when the ships would come to drop off more “merchandise”, but more importantly, new ingredients Yukie could cook with. Most everyone was kind to them, even the workers that Yukie had scuffled with a few months back. Note the word “most”; today was a day when the Pomeranian was also visiting. His obedient Dobermans were following in tow, as if the two people on this island had any desire to scrap with him. Well, that might not be entirely true, given that he was the reason Yukie was missing a chunk of their ear. Despite their personal feelings, they would greet Heixing with the utmost hospitality, enough to make him cringe, where any discomfort on his part brought Yukie unimaginable joy. Heixing was not the only annoying thing about today though. Enishi had been snappy as of late, and as soon as Yukie caught a glimpse of orange out of the corner of their eye, they tensed up and prepared for what else today might bring.</p>
 <p>“Yukie, why haven’t you made any tea yet?”</p>
 <p>“My apologies “boss”, I’ll get right on that,” they said sharply. Enishi already wore a furrowed brow, as if he had woken up like that. Yukie headed into the kitchen to prepare the tea tray, trying to curate a blend that might make both men look at them with something other than disdain. A few minutes later, they emerged, set the tray between them, passing out cups and pouring as needed, before they bowed and retreated back to the kitchen. Barely one foot was through the doorway before they heard a yelp from a kicked puppy and the crashing sound of china breaking. “What a fucking moron,” they thought, instantly knowing what had happened. They grabbed the broom and dustpan and made their way back out. </p>
 <p>“You need to give your maid a lesson on how to treat your guests,” Heixing chided.</p>
 <p>“Maybe you should think twice about drinking tea you know I just made,” Yukie shot back.</p>
 <p>“Don’t forget that I showed you mercy back then.”</p>
 <p>“Shut up, both of you,” Enishi interrupted, “Finish cleaning that up and make yourself useful elsewhere.” </p>
 <p>“We’re not even using my name now, huh?” Yukie thought. They finished collecting the broken pieces and wandered off again to the kitchen and out to the back. “Do this, do that, no “thank you” or a single pleasantry from anyone. I’ll just wait hand and foot for men born with a silver spoon in their mouth and both hands. Don’t worry about Yukie, they’ll just keep doing it because they’ll die back on the mainland. Would it kill you to ask if I might feel like shit here too?!” they ranted on, kicking a branch out of the way and they walked. “Two months of this and you’d think you’d be a little nicer to me by now. But noooo… Every. Single. Day. I work without being asked about anything beyond menial small talk. He was nicer to me when I first got here than he is now.” They continued walking around to the front of the mansion, eventually deciding to go sit on the beach for a while. Some of the crew was still on shore, enjoying a bit of downtime before they too would have to go back to being ordered around. The view was gorgeous, and despite Enishi’s threats of shark-infested waters, they still hadn’t been able to see one up close. “It must suck being used as leverage to keep others in line, huh?” they thought aloud, “You build a bad reputation just from the word of a few people who don’t know what they’re talking about, who don’t know how important and skillful you are.” They stood up, tying their yukata just above their knees so they could wade out into the glistening ocean. The water was cool enough to provide some relief on such a warm day, but not enough to bring their temper down.</p>
 <p>In due time, Yukie saw the enormous figures of the Si Shen emerge from the treeline, signaling the lapdog’s departure. They didn’t feel any duty to see him off, so they started back up the trail to the mansion. Upon arriving, the air inside felt stagnant and heavy. As expected, Enishi was sitting on one of the lounges, glasses in one hand and his other rubbing at his temple. Yukie didn’t feel the need to exchange words with him either and continued through to the kitchen, with only the intent to start doing anything after some sort of reconciliation. They heard Enishi get up, expecting to see him enter the kitchen, but instead just heard footsteps heading up the stairs. “Whatever. If he wants something, he’ll make it known.” </p>
 <p>Hours went by and Yukie carried on with their tasks as normal, taking frequent breaks to walk around the small gardens outside or to just lay down. When it came time for dinner, they considered caving in, but they knew it would only make way for more instances like this to occur. Instead, they make some rounds, checking out the state of the manor and making themselves look busy.</p>
 <p>“Hey,” a voice called out from the office. Knowing it had to be addressed to the only other person in the house now, they walked in, making sure their annoyance was visible.</p>
 <p>“I’m sorry, have you forgotten my name already?” they gawked at Enishi’s abrasive tone, “You had no issue bothering me constantly a few weeks ago, but now it’s like I’m a stranger again.”</p>
 <p>“I’ve just been busy, it’s nothing you need to be concerned with,” he started.</p>
 <p>“So why are you treating me like this?! If it’s nothing I’ve done, why are you acting like such a pathetic child!?”</p>
 <p>“I don’t need to explain that to–”</p>
 <p>“Then don’t, see if I care! You and this same, unspeakable reason for everything!” Yukie was yelling, so much so that they felt their throat immediately becoming dry. “Don’t expect a single thing from me. Don’t ask for me to make anything, don’t ask me to clean, don’t ask me to take care of your clothes, don’t speak– don’t even look at me! I’m fine with that! I’m fine with being treated like nothing, but I know that’s not something you can bear to deal with.”</p>
 <p>Yukie stormed off, slamming the door behind them hard enough that some books became dislodged from their shelves. Enishi hadn’t once moved from his desk, and carried on with his work as if nothing had happened. On the other side, Yukie found tears welling up in the corner of their eyes, but for what reason? They already knew half of the reason; her soft face was constantly staring back at them whenever she passed through the great room. She didn’t know who the woman was yet, but whoever she is, she weighs heavily on Enishi’s mind. A mother, perhaps a lover? Not that the specifics mattered in this moment. She made her way downstairs to speak with her, as if she was a deity that could provide some divination.</p>
 <p>Her pale skin contrasted hauntingly with her jet black hair and eyes. She was beautiful, there was no arguing on that front. There was no semblance of a smile on her face, but she gave off a warmth of love through the canvas. Yet still, Yukie felt a distinct coldness when standing in front of her, not unlike the harsh cold that clung to their skin when their father died. Yukie knew that the woman and herself shared something that Enishi was trying to cling onto, and that something was why he was acting this way. Visually, they looked quite different, save only for their dark hair. With how elegant and put together she looked in the photograph, certainly they couldn’t share any personality traits; there weren’t many women, let alone people in general, who were as crass and ill-mannered as Yukie. The only thing that could possible come to mind was how Yukie cooked for Enishi, which only made them want to stop cooking for him altogether.</p>
 <p>“I don’t know how you ever could have dealt with him,” they said aloud.</p>
 <p>“Dealt with who?” a voice called out from the stairwell, causing Yukie to jump more than they would have liked to.</p>
 <p>“Jerk.” they snapped back, “Who else would I be talking about,” they scoffed as they headed back towards the kitchen.</p>
 <p>“My sister,” he stated.</p>
 <p>“What?”</p>
 <p>“She was my sister.”</p>
 <p>Was. The thought of the woman being deceased had crossed their mind, but of course they had no way of confirming anything until now. Yukie slowed to a halt, but didn’t turn back to look at him. “She must have been important to you for you to have such a painting of her.”</p>
 <p>Enishi didn’t particularly want to divulge these sore wounds to them, but felt he didn’t have a choice after how he had been acting as of late. “I… She was murdered in front of my own eyes. By a man she never should have trusted.” Yukie felt their stomach drop at the revelation. </p>
 <p>“So what, you clawed your way up the Shanghai mafia to get revenge on her killer?” </p>
 <p>Enishi stared back silently and nodded. “Geh?!” they exclaimed, jumping a bit again, “you’ve got to be kidding me.” Enishi shook his head. “You’re serious!?” He nodded.</p>
 <p>Sighing, they continued, “I’m sure you have your reasons, and I won’t begrudge you for it. However,” they pointed an accusatory finger at Enishi, “that doesn’t give you the right to treat me like some lowly servant, when you, yourself, already proved to be more interested in me than I’m interested in you. Like I told you when I got here, I don’t really care about your personal life, business, whatever. I just expect you to treat me a little better than what I had gotten used to.”</p>
 <p>“I’ll do my best,” he replied.</p>
 <p>“Wrong answer,” they objected, “you’re going to do more than your best, because I’m not cooking for you.” Enishi furrowed his brow. “The only possible similarity between me and your sister has to be our ability to feed you, because there’s no way such a pretty lady is capable of treating you the way I do.” There was no arguing with that, though Enishi had his own opinions on who might be considered pretty as well. “You’re going to learn how to cook, and you’re going to learn right now,” she declared.</p>
 <p>“Fine, fine,” he gave in. If it meant keeping Yukie close, he would oblige. Deep down, he knew exactly why he was treating Yukie the way he was, stretching back to when they first met. It all had to do with Tomoe, whether either of them would come to realize. Even now, her presence, in whatever form it may be, was guiding the two of them together. </p>

          <details><summary>"I didn’t think it would snow here…” Yukie said aloud.</summary>
            <p>Enishi’s voice from behind startled them, having no clue he was right there, "We’re still technically in Japan, of course, it would snow here.”</p>
<p>"Shut up! How am I supposed to know it can snow this far south?”</p>
<p>"By the fact that we’re only some 150 kilometers from the mainland.”</p>
<p>"You say that like it’s a hop, skip, and a jump away…” Yukie muttered under their breath. They sighed, admiring the small flurry that was building outside. Their breath blew steam onto the window they were looking out of, and they drew a small circle in it with their finger. Enishi walked up closer behind them, "Didn’t you say you were from Hokkaido?”</p>
<p>Yukie turned to look at him with a sour look on their face, "When did I ever tell you that?”</p>
<p>Enishi returned the attitude, "Just a few weeks ago. You were complaining that it gets too warm here and that it should already be snowing.”</p>
<p>"Oh. I guess I did say that… Still… he remembered something like that?” they thought, “It would be though. You usually see the first snow in early November, and by now, it would be reaching its heaviest." In between looking out the window, Enishi peered around and took a small glance at Yukie, who was wearing an almost solemn look on their face. "Do you miss it?” he asked.</p>
<p>Yukie was taken slightly aback at his sudden interest in this topic. "I guess. I haven’t been there in years, I feel like I might die from the shock of the cold if I go back now.” Any other time, a comment like this would’ve been followed with a stifled laugh from Yukie, but not this time. They were in mourning over their home. "Sorry, I guess the snow is making me depressed,” they said, apologizing for the imagined discomfort they were causing. They leaned away from the window and stretched. “I'm gonna go make some tea,” they said before walking away. Enishi wasn’t quite done with the conversation, but he would wait to finish it later.</p>
<p>A handful of minutes later, Yukie was walking back with the tray of tea. “He’s probably in the drawing room right about now,” they thought to themselves. Knocking on the door before entering, they were right. Enishi was at his desk, writing something, probably business-related. Yukie stopped trying to ask what he was doing, for one reason being that they, by their admission, wouldn’t understand anything, and another being that Enishi would tell them it was none of their business anyway. They set the cup of tea down on his desk and poured it full, walking away after receiving no acknowledgment from Enishi, as per usual, until they reached the door again when he called out, "Wait.”</p>
<p>They froze in their tracks, mind racing with a million things he might have found out they did. Slowly they turned around, staggered to see Enishi looking back at them with a sympathetic look on his face. He had his hand on his temple, rubbing it as if this was something painful to say.</p>
<p>"Do you… want to go back to Hokkaido…?”</p>
<p>Yukie was shocked by his words. “Go…back…?” Quietly, they uttered, "I don’t…”</p>
<p>Not hearing them, Enishi cut them off, "I can arrange for the next relay ship to take you back. I'll be going to Shanghai for a week at the same time, so it all works out.” </p>
<p>“He’s lying, there’s no way he’d just let me go back so easily…” they thought. And they were right, but not for the same reason; Enishi was lying about his feelings. The whole time he spoke, he kept his head down, scribbling down words just to make himself look busy, and to hide his troubled, blushing face. Not only did he not want to send Yukie back at the risk of the mafia being exposed, but because he’d grown accustomed to living with them. It was the small things that made him feel alive again; hearing them hum to themselves while cleaning, noticing how focused and determined their eyes got when cooking, and seeing their smiling face bringing him tea every morning, which they had just done with a blank and sorrowful look instead, causing Enishi to bear a sharp pain in his chest. </p>
<p>"Ainu o hoppa…” Yukie muttered, just loud enough for Enishi to hear. He finally raised his head, looking at them with confusion.</p>
<p>“If you punch your wife before leaving, she won’t miss you. That’s what you’re trying to do, right?” Enishi stared at them in shock. They continued, "If you go to Shanghai and at the same time you send me to Hokkaido, you think it won’t hurt as much then.” They began walking over to Enishi’s desk, almost stomping. They slammed the tea tray down, their face contorted in anger, "Well you’re wrong!” they shouted. Still, Enishi couldn’t do anything but look at them in bewilderment. "Did you forget how stubborn I was the first time you tried to get rid of me?! You really think that’s gonna work a second time?! I told you right then that I can’t go back, not to Japan and especially not to Hokkaido!” Tears began welling at the corner of their eyes, "There’s no place for me there… not anymore…”</p>
<p>No place for me anymore. That was the exact feeling Enishi held after Tomoe died. When he fled Japan, knowing that it wasn’t worth living in a country where his sister was murdered, made to be by the man who killed her. He wondered, “What have they gone through that I don’t know about?”</p>
<p>Yukie’s head dropped, gritting their teeth, desperately trying to keep tears in. Then, before he knew what he was doing, Enishi’s hand reached out to push Yukie’s hair back, but they jumped back in surprise before he could. He was caught in the act, but he kept his composure and slowly let down his arm. Yukie almost thought they were hallucinating.</p>
<p>They stood in silence for a while, not sure whether or not they should acknowledge what just almost happened. After what felt like an hour, Yukie was the one to break the stalemate.</p>
<p>"Of course, I wanna go home, don’t get me wrong, but… I don’t wanna go back like this.”
<p>"What do you mean like this?” Enishi questioned.</p>
<p>Yukie averted their gaze to answer, "Like… by myself…” they uttered. Enishi felt a different sharp pain in his chest this time, accidentally showing it on his face. “They can’t mean…”</p>
<p>Yukie noticed, shouting out, "It doesn’t matter! I'm not going back! You can have fun in Shanghai or whatever, but I'm staying right here!” They turned away to finally walk out of the office, slamming the door behind them. Enishi let his head fall into his hand, covering his face even though there was no one to see it. “What’s wrong with me lately…” he wondered.</p>
<p>On the other side of the door, Yukie was thinking the same thing.<br>
–<br>
<p>"It’s snowing again!” Yukie’s voice rang through the mansion to Enishi, who was just waking up and walking downstairs. "Ah, good mornin’!” they called out upon seeing him. Enishi nodded in response, "Good morning.” He wanted to remark how it seemed like they felt better from their conversation the other day, but held his tongue in fear it might reopen a wound for either of them. "I already got breakfast made, it’s ready if you want any,” they said. "Thanks,” Enishi responded. Just as they were about to walk out of sight, once again he called out to them, “Yukie…”</p>
<p>"Hm? What is it? He never calls out just my name…”</p>
<p>Enishi felt his words getting stuck in his throat, but managed to croak out, "You don’t have to do any extra work today. You can take a walk in the snow if you’d like.” Yukie stared at him, offended. Enishi didn’t know what he’d said wrong. "I was planning on doing that anyway, whether you told me to or not,” they said, storming off. But not before Enishi grabbed their wrist, with Yukie immediately pulling it away. "What’s the big idea?! You’ve been weird lately!”</p>
<p>"Let me go with you.”</p>
<p>Yukie's face displayed simultaneously pure horror and astonishment, materializing with a strong blush. "Hold on a second–!”</p>
<p>"That wasn’t a request, I'm going with you.” Enishi walked off to get his coat, leaving Yukie to try and process what just happened.<br>
–<br>
<p>The two walked through the woods together, with Yukie almost falling down the path twice. “I'm still not used to this terrain here…” they thought.</p>
<p>Eventually, they made their way out and onto the beach. The sky was a bright gray, with the snow falling heavier and faster than it was when they had left. The snow wasn’t sticking very much to the sand, but it didn’t matter to Yukie. They were a far cry from the solemn person they were the other day, back to their normal, ever-cheerful demeanor. They stuck their hand out to catch a snowflake and, upon doing so, brought it close to their face to try and examine its shape before it melted. They did this for a while, catching each snowflake they could and taking note of its shape. Soon enough, a light dusting of snow could finally be seen on the sand. "Enishi! The snow’s finally sticking!” they called out. He smiled to himself, knowing he was standing far enough away that they wouldn’t be able to tell. Eventually, he made his way over to them to see what they were doing, which was placing their hand to leave a print in the snow. They smiled and laughed to themselves. "Hey, you do it too,” they urged. Enishi complied, crouching down next to them and placing his hand in the snow right next to theirs. Their hands weren’t all so different in size, but Enishi’s fingers were longer than Yukie’s, which were shorter, but more slender even than Enishi’s.</p>
<p>"Back home, my father and I would compare our hand sizes in the snow every day, but mine were hardly ever half the size of his,” they said, letting out a grin. "But that didn’t ever stop me from trying to use his makiri that I could barely wrap my hands around.”
<p>"Makiri?” Enishi questioned.</p>
<p>"Ah... it’s a short knife. When a man carves a makiri, it’s a great show of their craftsmanship and ability to provide,” they paused to look up. "He carved one for my mother when he was courting her, now it’s the only thing I have left of either of them.” Enishi could see the sorrow building up in them. </p>
<p>"You have your name.”</p>
<p>“...what?” Yukie looked startled.</p>
<p>"Not long after you came here, you said your name meant ‘an era of blessings’, that your father gave you that name.”</p>
<p>"Yeah…” they drawled out, taking a moment to decide if they should continue, “...for a second… I thought you meant my real name, and I knew I'd never told you that before. I woulda thought you were seriously weird if you happened to figure it out somehow.”</p>
<p>"Your real name?”</p>
<p>“Yukie is my Japanese name. My father thought I could live a more normal life with a Japanese name,” they admitted, leaning back slightly, "I guess normal is subjective, ‘cause this is the most normal my life has been since then.”</p>
<p>Enishi began piecing the bits of information Yukie had dropped to him over the past months, finally understanding something about them, "You’re an Ainu?” he asked.</p>
<p>"What? You didn’t know…?” they said, cocking their eyebrows.</p>
<p>"You never said it outright. I figured it out based on the things you’ve been saying.”</p>
<p>Yukie looked astonished, turning back away from Enishi and fiddling with their hair, clearly waiting for him to say something else.</p>
<p>Enishi tilted his head to try and meet Yukie’s eyes, "So, what’s your real name?”</p>
<p>Time and time again, Enishi’s forwardness was catching them off guard, and time again they had to avert their gaze to respond. </p>
<p>"Ruyanpe.”</p>
<p>"Rui–”</p>
<p>"Ru-ya-n-pe. It means rain.”</p>
<p>"Ru-ya-n-pe. Ruyanpe.” Enishi continued sounding it out. "Ruyanpe… if it means rain, what’s snow?”</p>
<p>"Upas.”</p>
<p>"Upas?”</p>
<p>"You got it!” They smiled at Enishi, warming him slightly from the cold.</p>
<p>After sitting together in silence for a while, Yukie broke it once again.</p>
<p>"Gyahh!! It’s cold out!” they said, standing up and holding their arms across their body to warm up. "I should’ve grabbed something heavier…” Enishi stood up as well, once more letting his body act before his mind. He grasped one of Yukie’s hands, bringing it up to his mouth to blow hot air onto it. This time, Yukie didn’t retract their hand, simply because the cold matched with the complete and utter disbelief left them frozen in place. Enishi kept eye contact with them the whole time, looking over his glasses to ask, "Better?” before dropping their hand and walking past them. "I have things I need to do; I'm going back.” Snapping out of their trance, they ran after him, but not before scooping off some snow from a nearby tree branch and shoving it down his coat. "What was that for?!” he demanded.</p>
<p>"You know damn well what that was for!!” a blushing Yukie shouted back, pointing an accusatory finger at him. A bloom began to show on Enishi’s face as well, so he quickly turned away. They both stood there for a moment, unmoving until Yukie walked in front of Enishi.</p>
<p>"You coming or not?” they barked back to him, "You said you had things to do, and now you’re cold and wet. It’s just gonna freeze if you don’t get a move on.” they started up the path without him, but it wasn't too much longer before he was right behind them. He took his coat off and placed it on top of them, obscuring their vision. "You can forget what I said about doing extra work today, wash that when we get back,” he badgered. Yukie snapped back, "I was gonna do that anyways, whether you asked me to or not.” He didn’t look at their face, but he knew they had a smirk on it, as did his own. It was becoming increasingly clear to him that the next week without Yukie was going to be more difficult than he wanted to admit.</p>

          <div class="title">Rom-Com Tropes are Contagious</div>
          <details><summary>“What the hell are you doing?” Enishi called out from behind them.</summary>
           <p>Yukie jumped slightly at the sudden sound of his voice, “What does it look like, dumbass? I’m making you something to eat, obviously,” they barked back.</p> 
<p>“Like hell you are. Go back to bed,” he ordered.</p>
<p>“I feel perfectly fine now! If I don’t cook something for you, you’re just gonna waste away to nothing! You can’t just keep training for hours upon end without a break!” they yelled, before doubling over and breaking into a coughing fit.</p>
<p>“What good will that do if I get sick from your cooking then?” Enishi said, walking over to them, ignoring their completely justified concern.</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly insulting my cooking?” Yukie retorted.</p>
<p>“I mean from you coughing and sneezing all over it,” Enishi corrected himself.</p>
<p>“Then stay away from me if you’re so worried about catching my cold!” they continued.</p>
<p>“Not gonna happen,” he said, crouching down in front of them, before suddenly picking them up and throwing them over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Wha–?! Put me down, asshole!” they scolded, kicking and hitting him on the back, to which Enishi remained completely unfazed. </p>
<p>“Keep moving around and I’ll drop you,” he warned.</p>
<p>“Go ahead! I didn’t ask you to carry me like a barrel of tofu back to my room!” they spurred on. Enishi suddenly loosened his grip on Yukie, who instinctively grabbed Enishi’s jacket to hold on tighter.</p>
<p>“Oh?” he sneered, “so you don’t want me to let go of you?”</p>
<p>“Shut up…!” they hissed, “You’re the reason I get myself sick," they muttered. They were barely glad Enishi was carrying them this way, otherwise he’d be able to see the growing blush on their face. They tightened their grip on his jacket as he carried them up the stairs.</p>
<p>After a few moments of silence, Enishi spoke again, “What were you even making?”</p>
<p>“...Jī yā xiě tāng,” they uttered.</p>
<p>“Jī yā xiě tāng? Where the hell did you learn to make that?”</p>
<p>“I asked one of your ships’ guys to bring me back a cookbook the last time they were here, and obviously some ingredients. I still can’t read Chinese very well, so I was guessing a lot of the directions and stuff… but I just thought you might like to have some Shanghainese food for a change…” they admitted.</p>
<p>“So you settled for chicken and duck blood soup?” Enishi questioned.</p>
<p>“It sounded the most similar to an Ainu dish,” they protested, “and apparently it has medicinal value, which I figured would help you since you’ve been training so much.”</p>
<p>Enishi sighed, “You’re always worrying too much about me, that’s why you always get sick,” he insisted.</p>
<p>“I am your maid, that’s like my entire job,” they pointed out.</p>
<p>“Right, my maid… that’s all they are to me,” Enishi reminded himself.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally reaching Yukie’s room, Enishi readjusted Yukie to be able to open the door, earning an involuntary yelp from them, which Enishi felt his heart jump at.</p>
<p>“We’re back at your room,” Enishi announced, turning the doorknob and walking inside. </p>
<p>“Thank god, I thought you were never going to put me down,” they exasperated, moving to break free from Enishi’s iron grip on them.</p>
<p>“Wait, let me–” Enishi was cut off by Yukie accidentally pulling him forward as they tried to get down, forcing Enishi to act in a moment's notice, catching them and falling forwards onto their bed, their faces just inches apart. One of Enishi’s hands was bracing their back and the other was placed firmly beside them to break his own fall.</p>
<p>“I was going to set you down on the bed,” Enishi huffed.</p>
<p>“Let go of me,” Yukie chided, not listening to what Enishi had to say for himself.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who’s still holding on,” he informed them. Their arms were wrapped around his neck, holding on even tighter than they were when he joked about dropping them, almost pulling his jacket off his shoulders. Yukie’s face was flushed a slight shade of pink, just enough for it to be noticeable. They were obviously embarrassed, but, for once, they were keeping their eyes locked with his. Whether it be a sign of protest at the situation they were stuck in, or a show of their bullheaded will, Enishi would just find it endearing. Eventually, they loosened their grip on his clothes, dropping their arms from around him.</p>
<p>“Can you get up now?” they pressed, turning their head away from him but still keeping sure to maintain eye contact. Enishi pushed himself back off the bed and started out of their room, figuring it to be best if he didn’t say another word. Shutting the door carefully behind him, he took off his glasses to let his head fall into his hand.</p>
<p>“There’s seriously something wrong with me…” he thought to himself, “but… I wasn’t imagining that, was I?” </p>
<p>He called back to the instant he caught Yukie, who, despite their squawking, had immediately pulled themselves back into Enishi’s shoulder as they realized they were falling. And when they pulled back, Enishi could’ve sworn he caught them glancing between him and his lips, before they finally locked their eyes with his.</p>
<p>From the other side of the door, Yukie was sorting out their own recollection of what just happened. They moved fully onto their bed, resting the back of their hand on their forehead. “Damn. Now I’ve really caught a fever ‘cause of this guy…” they thought out-loud.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, a raucous sneeze echoed through the downstairs of the mansion.</p>
