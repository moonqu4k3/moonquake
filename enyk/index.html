     <div class="title">What is EniYukie?</div>
      <b>EniYukie (a.k.a EniRuy, sometimes abbr. ENYK)</b> is the name of my self-ship/OCxCanon ship with Enishi Yukishiro from Rurouni Kenshin. This page is a sort of shrine/info page/directory of all things ENYK related. I plan to keep a gallery of all my commissioned pieces, self-drawn pieces, and writing about them.</div>

     <div class="title">Who is Yukie?</div>
      <i>Yukie (given name Ruyanpe) Hokuto</i> is my self-insert OC for Rurouni Kenshin. They were born in modern day Erimo and raised in an Ainu village. After her father's death (caused by slavery) in her early teens, Yukie would attempt to get revenge until they were gravely wounded, creating a shooting star shaped scar and leaving them with minimal usage of their right arm. Yukie would spend the next years as a vagrant, desperately trying to survive in the changing landscape of mainland Japan.</div>
  
 <div id="box2">
   <div class="title">Who is Enishi?</div>
    <b>Enishi Yukishiro</b> is the antagonist of the Jinchu Arc of Rurouni Kenshin. He is the younger brother of Tomoe Yukishiro, Kenshin's wife during the Bakumatsu, who would be unfortunately slain by Kenshin during a battle for her life. Enishi witnessed his sister's murder and would be driven mad with rage, spending the next decade and a half planning his "Jinchu" (lit. "human punishment"; derived from "Tenchu" ["heavenly punishment"], a word often seen on assassination letters during the Bakumatsu) against Kenshin. He would eventually rise to the top of the Shanghai Mafia, giving him access to everything he could possibly need to turn Kenshin's life into a living hell.

    <div class="title">How They Met</div>
        <i>Yukie and Enishi</i> met after Yukie snuck aboard a ship that they believed was heading to Shanghai, as they were more than eager to leave Japan altogether by this point in their life. However, the ship was actually going to Enishi's island hideout to fund his Jinchu plot. After being caught, Yukie is dragged offboard, first meeting the second-in-command of the Shanghai Mafia, Wu Heixing. Letting their audacity get the best of them, Yukie taunts Heixing until he shoots off a part of their right ear. Enishi, carrying trauma of his sister being killed, orders Heixing to stand down.<br><br>
Yukie and Enishi barter for a while, before Yukie proposes an absurd deal: allow them to remain on his island and they will work as a live-in maid. Partially spurred on by the sickening sight of blood dripping down Yukie's neck, Enishi surprisingly agrees to their deal, under one condition: they will remain out of each other's business. Well... maybe this webpage will help you figure out how that held up.

    <div class="title">Relationship Details</div>
        <b>Yukie and Enishi</b> suffer from oblivious idiot syndrome. Both believe that there's no way the other has any feelings towards the other, despite the piercing blushes that both of their faces display when they're near each other. <br><br>
    Yukie works as Enishi's made, though she's kind of a bad one. She can be quite lazy at times, but is really good at cooking, so everything else can be forgiven. Her other work duties inlcude rooting around in Enishi's belongings under the guise of "cleaning" and bothering Enishi.<br><br>
    Enishi and Yukie are both tsunderes; Enishi's the more smug type, and Yukie the more outbursting type. Enishi has a somewhat sophisticated image he tries to keep up, but he's really kind of a dickhead and that slips out a lot. Yukie is the much more typical "I think I'm going to kill you if you even look at me" all said while furiously blushing type of tsundere.
    EniYukie is the protege of Misaki x Usui, RanAka, AsuCaga, LoidYor, Royai and EdWin, BanGinji, Kyoru, and HakYona.

     <div class="title">Tomoe & Yukie</div>
       <i>Yukie is a foil of Tomoe,</i> Enishi's deceased sister. Yukie is nearly everything Tomoe was not, which forces Enishi to grapple with his complex surrounding Tomoe and eventually accepting Yukie as they are, rather than projecting the image of his sister onto them.

   <div class="title">TomoKen & EniYukie</div>
   <b>Respectively, TomoKen and EniYukie are sister ships.</b> The Yukishiro siblings both develop unwanted feelings for their significant others while attempting to carry out revenge plans, changing them both for the better. Kenshin and Yukie come from disadvantaged backgrounds and carry a serious expression and personality through their teenage years, before developing a more cheerful demeanor.

   <div class="title">Yukie's Names</div>
       <i>Yukie's Japanese name, Hokuto Yukie, is written as 北斗 由紀恵.</i> Hokuto is from Hokuto Shichisei, the Japanese word for the Big Dipper, the constellation that is often used to locate the North Star, Polaris. Yukie is written with the kanji for, "reason", "era", and "blessings". Their name was frankensteined from Yukie Chiri and Iboshi Hokuto, two prominent Ainu scholars. Their given Ainu name, Ruyanpe (ルヤンペ when written in katakana), means rain, and comes from their tendency to play in the rain often, and where the rainiest months of the year are often around their birthday.

   <div class="title">Animal Motifs</div>
  <b>Enishi is canonically associated with a tiger, and Yukie's motif is that of an Eastern buzzard.</b> Enishi's tiger motif is a foil to Kenshin's dragon motif (associated with yin & yang; two sides of the same coin). Yukie's is a buzzard because of their generalist diet, which is reminiscient of Yukie's survival tendencies during their life as a vagrant.

     <i>Being based off late 90s and 00s anime couples,</i> they fall into more than a couple familiar tropes. Most notably, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Beligerent Sexual Tension</a>, Tsundere x  Tsundere, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther">Aw, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other</a>, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther">Oblivious to Love</a>, and many, many more.
