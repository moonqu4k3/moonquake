   <div class="title">Why Enishi?</div>
      <b>I have no idea.</b> I had been into RuroKen since I was born basically thanks to my 18 years older otaku brother and I'm convinced he would put the anime on to put me to sleep. I had read the manga numerous times throughout my youth, but when I read it again at 12, apparently, that was the time that I guess I could process everything it delved into (or I desperately needed distraction from The Fog of Being Twelve Years Old), and I really latched onto Enishi and <a href="https://moonquake.pages.dev/tmkn">TomoKen</a>. There is unfortunately something very comforting about a 23 year old man with a personality disorder who just discovered complimentary colors. Anyways, as time went on, other anime crushes came and went, but Enishi always stayed. Around when I was 18, I definitely started feeling a lot deeper about him, and in due time, EniYukie was born.</div>

          <div class="title">What was the creation process of Yukie?</div>
          <i>Yukie is</i> a combination of the person I wanted to be and the person I am. I say wanted to be in the past tense because I feel that, through writing ENYK, I've been able to grow and take on the traits I gave Yukie that were desirable to me. Visually, Yukie and I are more or less identical, even down to the placement of our moles. I do have two full ears though. Yukie is Ainu for the sole reason I am L'nu. I enjoy making characters who are also indigenous and it has been fun to learn more about Ainu culture through creating her.<br><br>
Seeing as RuroKen is set in the Meiji Era in the years following the annexation of Hokkaido and a great increase in racism towards the Ainu, I wanted to explore themes of belonging and prejudice with Yukie, as RuroKen doesn't focus too much on the politics of Meiji Era Japan outside the point of views of the Yamato Japanese samurai who fought in the Bakumastu. How being disconnected from your culture for a long period of time, no matter who deeply you care for it, you will still find yourself succumbing to the whims of those in power (being the assimilation of Ainu into Japanese culture via taking on Japanese names and the erasure of the language; it's why Yukie goes by Yukie and not Ruyanpe for a large part of her story).
