          <p>Below are my boundaries surrounding Enishi and ENYK:</p>
          <li><i>Other Enishi self-shippers:</i> I know for a fact there are not any in the Western hemisphere, but if we somehow do manage to cross paths, I would rather not interact, or at the very least steer away from this topic of conversation. Enishi and EniYukie are deeply personal to me and I can get a bit territorial.</li>
          <li><b>Other RuroKen self-shippers:</b> Pleaseeee be my friend. Like seriously if you exist please talk to me.</li>
          <li><i>Fan creation boundaries:</i></li>
              <ul>I am always willing to pay for any art/writing/creations featuring ENYK if you would like to create them! Even if you want to do it for free for whatever reason please let me tip you or create something in return!</ul>
              <ul>I do ask that no NSFW (or generally suggestive) works be created without expression consultation with me first.</ul>
          <li><b>I am not here to argue about RuroKen's author & right to exist:</b> I've been a fan for my whole life, obviously I know Nobuhiro Watsuki is a pedophile. I do not and have not financially supported the franchise since; everything I own is from a decade ago or secondhand. If you try and start a conversation with me about it/make a comment about it, I am blocking you.</li>

          <div class="title">Is Yukie a sona?</div>
          <p><i>Effectively, yes.</i> Considering RuroKen takes place in Meiji Era Japan, it doesn't make much sense for my "yumesona" to be just me. I've been a self-shipper for eons, and I've always had a self-insert OC for them. As much as I will lead you to believe otherwise, Yukie is still their own character, and it's never my intention to pass myself off as an expert of late 1800s Ainu/Japanese relations and history. I do my best to learn, but I am going to make mistakes here and there. ENYK is always a work in progress.</p>
