   <div class="title">Why Enishi?</div>
      <b>I have no idea.</b> I had been into RuroKen since I was born basically thanks to my 18 years older otaku brother and I'm convinced he would put the anime on to put me to sleep. I had read the manga numerous times throughout my youth, but when I read it again at 12, apparently, that was the time that I guess I could process everything it delved into (or I desperately needed distraction from The Fog of Being Twelve Years Old), and I really latched onto Enishi and <a href="https://moonquake.pages.dev/tmkn">TomoKen</a>. There is unfortunately something very comforting about a 23 year old man with a personality disorder who just discovered complimentary colors. Anyways, as time went on, other anime crushes came and went, but Enishi always stayed. Around when I was 18, I definitely started feeling a lot deeper about him, and in due time, EniYukie was born.

          <div class="title">How long have you self-shipped with Enishi?</div>
          <i>Openly about 3 years,</i> but privately, much, much longer. As I mentioned in the first box, I started self-shipping with him starting when I was around 18. The current (in the sense that an OC named Yukie was created and shipped with Enishi; things have obviously changed since the first inception) EniYukie was born on August 5, 2022, which is the official unofficial EniYukie anniversary date. In terms of their story, their "true" anniversary date is 4/4. I've been working on their story ever since August 2022 and I don't intend on stopping any time soon.

          <div class="title">Is Yukie a sona?</div>
          <b>Effectively, yes.</b> Considering RuroKen takes place in Meiji Era Japan, it doesn't make much sense for my "yumesona" to be just me. I've been a self-shipper for eons, and I've always had a self-insert OC for them. As much as I will lead you to believe otherwise, Yukie is still their own character, and it's never my intention to pass myself off as an expert of late 1800s Ainu/Japanese relations and history. I do my best to learn, but I am going to make mistakes here and there. ENYK is always a work in progress.</p>

          <div class="title">Where can I read more about them?</div>
          <b>You can read parts of their story under the "Lore" page!</b> I do also maintain a Google Doc with the same entries that are posted on here, which you can access <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEic7vh6tBbnDIYbLNRmhsWzTLQD0tGdjo-PA2jiIBY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. It may be useful if you find it difficult to read large amounts of text on this site.

          <div class="title">What was the creation process of Yukie?</div>
          <i>Yukie is</i> a combination of the person I wanted to be and the person I am. I say wanted to be in the past tense because I feel that, through writing ENYK, I've been able to grow and take on the traits I gave Yukie that were desirable to me. Visually, Yukie and I are more or less identical, even down to the placement of our moles. I do have two full ears though. Yukie is Ainu for the sole reason I am L'nu. I enjoy making characters who are also indigenous and it has been fun to learn more about Ainu culture through creating her.<br><br>
Seeing as RuroKen is set in the Meiji Era in the years following the annexation of Hokkaido and a great increase in racism towards the Ainu, I wanted to explore themes of belonging and prejudice with Yukie, as RuroKen doesn't focus too much on the politics of Meiji Era Japan outside the point of views of the Yamato Japanese samurai who fought in the Bakumastu. How being disconnected from your culture for a long period of time, no matter who deeply you care for it, you will still find yourself succumbing to the whims of those in power (being the assimilation of Ainu into Japanese culture via taking on Japanese names and the erasure of the language; it's why Yukie goes by Yukie and not Ruyanpe for a large part of her story).

          <div class="title">What are your boundaries</div>
            <p><i>Below are my boundaries surrounding Enishi and ENYK:</i></p>
            <li><b>Other Enishi self-shippers:</b> I know for a fact there are not any in the Western hemisphere, but if we somehow do manage to cross paths, I would rather not interact, or at the very least steer away from this topic of conversation. Enishi and EniYukie are deeply personal to me and I can get a bit territorial.</li>
            <li><i>Other RuroKen self-shippers:</i> Pleaseeee be my friend. Like seriously if you exist please talk to me.</li>
            <li><b>Fan creation boundaries:</b></li>
                <ul>I am always willing to pay for any art/writing/creations featuring ENYK if you would like to create them! Even if you want to do it for free for whatever reason please let me tip you or create something in return!</ul>
                <ul>I do ask that no NSFW (or generally suggestive) works be created without expression consultation with me first.</ul>
            <li><i>I am not here to argue about RuroKen's author & right to exist:</i> I've been a fan for my whole life, obviously I know Nobuhiro Watsuki is a pedophile. I do not and have not financially supported the franchise since; everything I own is from a decade ago or secondhand. If you try and start a conversation with me about it/make a comment about it, I am blocking you.</li>
