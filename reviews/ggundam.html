							<code><b>rating:</b> 7.5/10</code>
							<p>Sometimes you come across a show that so perfectly encapsulates the 90s anime industry, cultural perceptions (for better and worse), and trends of the era. G Gundam is a show that does that.</p><br>
							
							<code><b>Story:</b>7/10</code>
							<p>The best way to describe G Gundam is campy. When your main premise is a world-wide Gundam battle for the rights to rule Earth and space as a form of election and every country has the prefix "Neo", how can it not be. Our protagonist, Domon Kasshu, is enrolled in the Gundam Fight for Neo Japan not solely for it's glory, but rather to search for the Devil Gundam, a super Gundam with crazy power that his brother stole from his father's lab. The series generally follows a battle of the week format with the overaching stories of 1) finding and defeating the Devil Gundam and 2) winning the Gundam Fight. As it goes on though, the mystery of his brother, Kyoji, the Devil Gundam, the Gundam Fight, and many other people Domon knows slowly converge together. While it's a pretty predictable storyline, there are plenty of twists and turns. What is the strange connection between Neo Germany's Schwarz Bruder and his inexplicable mentor behavior towards Domon? Why has Master Asia taken the side of the Devil Gundam?</p><br>

								I'm certainly not going to discount the racial insensitivites of G Gundam, though. While there is a certain level of camp where the Neo Holland Gundam is a windmill, when the Neo India Gundam is a cobra and the pilot is a stereotypical snake charmer (and green for some reason???)... yeah. There's no denying that it can be objectionably racist. This is from 1994, btw. As in 32 years ago. I have siblings older than G Gundam. No excuse for it.</p><br>
							
							<code><b>Characters:</b> 8/10</code>
							<p>Although G Gundam relies on plenty of sterotyping, the characters are far from one-dimensional. The main five are all engaging in their own ways and have individually touching character arcs and motivations. The range of characters is pretty diverse as well, ranging from a literal 12 year old to an old sailor man, and they're generally all engaging. The villian of the day format of much of the series obviously doesn't allow much for those characters to grow, but G Gundam does pull a fast one on you and brings a couple of them back throughout the show for various reasons. It makes the story feel like it really is tied all together well, as there are certainly characters in other Gundam shows that get their moment in the spotlight and are then never to be heard from again, but are simultaneously expected to be universally loved and remembered (coughRambaRalcough). Overall, the female cast doesn't have to deal with a terrible amount of mistreatment. Rain gets the brunt of it, but I think they're able to work much of it into her own character arc and self-sabotaging tendencies, much in the same way Domon does. Their relationship is quite realistic for a pair of 20-somethings being thrust into the Worst Year Ever, and learning to deal their feelings amidst it all. Chibodee's harem is relatively well treated, but if they got a bit more characterization individually, rather than as a unit, I would enjoy them a fair bit more. Nastasha is easily the most interesting member of the side cast, not only aesthetically, but personality wise as well. I would have loved if they had an episode dedicated to her background within Neo Russia, because she certainly hints at some underlying issues throughout the series. I consider Allenby to be a main cast member, and she totally clears. Imagine me waving a flag that says "I <3 BLUE HAIRED CYBER NEWTYPES* (*and all their spinoff archetypes)".</p><br>
							<p>My biggest complaint as far as characters go is with the final antagonist, Major Ulube. He is an awful twist villain. I mean, you are conditioned at this point in the Gundamverse to suspect that the masked character is a villian in some form, but they really dropped the ball with him. He disappears halfway through the Gundam Fight finals, only to show back up as the Big Bad and then dies within 2 episodes. BOOOOORING. Master Asia on the other hand is an incredibly compelling antagonist and probably one of my favorite Gundam antagonists thus far. He is complex, has his own twists, always steals the spotlight as a good villian should do, and is all around a likeable villian. Even Wong is more intriguing than Ulube.</p>
				
							<code><b>Pacing:</b> 7/10</code>
							<p>One of the biggest complaints I see about G Gundam is regarding the pacing. Personally, I thought it was relatively good. It's a 49 episode show and I felt that it kept the story going well overall. Sure, there are some "filler" episodes, but in a show that is far more focused on the individual cast and motives of its characters, they aren't jarring to watch or break immersion. Personally, I define filler as an episode that holds zero impact on the overarching story and nothing will be amiss if you skip it. Seeing as all the so-called filler episodes typically tackled a main cast member's motivation for joining the Gundam Fight, therefore fleshing them out, I would never call them filler. I think some of you just can't watch shows that aren't all hype moments and aura. Sometimes it's nice to watch an episode about Sai Saici navigating a crush on the younger sister of his opponent. It certainly made me a bigger fan of his character and it furthered the plot by showcasing a Gundam Fight. The story felt like it wrapped up quite well and succintly.</p><br>
					
							<code><b>Visuals:</b> 8/10</code>
							<p>Not touching on the crazy ass Gundam designs just yet in favor of reviewing the overall aesthetic of G Gundam. I'm obviously a fan of the 90s anime style, particularly the sharp hair and eyes, waterslide noses, and legs longer than a ladder anime style of the 90s. And these angular designs are never muddled in moments of action which is equally sharp, but never jerky. I can't really call any moments where the animation was abhorrent, certainly there are some episodes where you can tell a different art director was in charge, but there was nothing that made me recoil or make a specific mental note of.</p><br>
              <p>Ok now I can talk about the Gundam designs. Neo Holland is a windmill. Neo America is a cowboy/football player/boxer. Neo Egypt is a Pharoah. You see what I mean? The designs themselves, attempting to ignore the aforementioned racial insensitivities, are sick. For the most part. Mandala Gundam is goofy looking despite it having a pretty interesting pilot and ability, and the Jester Gundam is.... ???? It just is. Domon's two primary suits, Shining Gundam and God Gundam, are the most "normal" out of them all, and I do like how clean the God Gundam is. </p><br>
					
							<code><b>Final Thoughts</b></code>
							<p>G Gundam is most certainly the most unique entry in Gundam. Nothing has been made quite like it before, or likely ever will be since. Coming off the tail end of the U.C. timeline into a far less "serious" calendar era may have been unpopular at the time, but the cultural staying power of G Gundam can't be denied; the Tequila Gundam is still the focus of hundreds of posts, kitbashes, and merchandise to this very day. While not a perfect show by any means, I find it plenty endearing and would reccommend it even to the most gung-ho of mecha fans. It's a genuine treat.</p>
