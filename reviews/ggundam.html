							<code><b>rating:</b> 7.5/10</code>
							<p>Sometimes you come across a show that so perfectly encapsulates the 90s anime industry, cultural perceptions (for better and worse), and trends of the era. G Gundam is a show that does that.</p><br>
							
							<code><b>Story:</b>7/10</code>
							<p>The best way to describe G Gundam is campy. When you a. I'm certainly not going to discount the racial insensitivites of G Gundam, though. </p><br>
							
							<code><b>Characters:</b> 8/10</code>
							<p>Although G Gundam relies on plenty of sterotyping, the characters are far from one-dimensional. The main five are all engaging in their own ways and have individually touching character arcs and motivations. </p><br>
				
							<code><b>Pacing:</b> 7/10</code>
							<p>One of the biggest complaints I see about G Gundam is regarding the pacing. Personally, I thought it was relatively good. It's a 49 episode show and I felt that it kept the story going well overall. Sure, there are some "filler" episodes, but in a show that is far more focused on the individual cast and motives of its characters, they aren't jarring to watch or break immersion. Personally, I define filler as an episode that holds zero impact on the overarching story and nothing will be amiss if you skip it. Seeing as all the so-called filler episodes typically tackled a main cast member's motivation for joining the Gundam Fight, therefore fleshing them out, I would never call them filler. I think some of you just can't watch shows that aren't all hype moments and aura. Sometimes it's nice to watch an episode about Sai Saici navigating a crush on the younger sister of his opponent. It certainly made me a bigger fan of his character and it furthered the plot by showcasing a Gundam Fight.</p><br>
					
							<code><b>Visuals:</b> 8/10</code>
							<p>Not touching on the crazy ass Gundam designs just yet in favor of reviewing the overall aesthetic of G Gundam. I'm obviously a fan of the 90s anime style, particularly the sharp hair and eyes, waterslide noses, and legs longer than a ladder anime style of the 90s. And these angular designs are never muddled in moments of action which is equally sharp, but never jerky. I can't really call any moments where the animation was abhorrent, certainly there are some episodes where you can tell a different art director was in charge, but there was nothing that made me recoil or make a specific mental note of.</p><br>
              <p>Ok now I can talk about the Gundam designs. Neo Holland is a windmill. Neo America is a cowboy/football player/boxer. Neo Egypt is a Pharoah. You see what I mean? The designs themselves, attempting to ignore the aforementioned racial insensitivities, are sick. For the most part. Mandala Gundam is goofy looking despite it having a pretty interesting pilot and ability, and the Jester Gundam is.... ???? It just is. Domon's two primary suits, Shining Gundam and God Gundam, are the most "normal" out of them all, and I do like how clean the God Gundam is. </p><br>

							<p>Mobile Fighter G Gundam receives the vorepride stamp of approval.</p>
