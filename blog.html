                    <code>✶♫⋆<b> Listening to...</b> Morning Glory - BeForU</code>
                    <p>I've been watching a lottt of anime lately. Since last year, I've been making my way through the entire Gundam catalog, and so far I've watched 18 (i think?) of the entries, starting from the OG 1979 series. I've also been making my way through some shows I had long put off, like Sonny Boy, and trying to keep up with some of the seasonal releases. In doing so though, I've really had to become enlightened to the current anime streaming ecosystem. I've used Crunchyroll for the better part of a decade at this point, and I was a veteran of the VRV days (god rest her soul), and held a simultaneous Funimation membership before and after that. As you may know, Funimation got bought out by Sony (the owner of CR) in 2021 and it was a huge blow to the anime community, with many feeling that we were heading towards a near monopoly with CR. It has taken 4 years (and counting) since the acquisition of Funimation for the shows hosted there to make their way over to CR. I remember when phase 1 of the shift began, a Twitter user compiled a spreadsheet of all the shows that were nowhere to be streamed, and it was a ridiculous number (something like 1000+ iirc) with some high-profile shows among them (according to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a26y6sN_-GyK7PKatJmBPSL7idETFWa4qmDpvmHoE-c/edit?tab=t.0">this list</a>, it's still nearly 200 shows).</p>
					<p>As much as I would hate a total anime monopoly (for reasons I'll especially get into in a bit), I do also hate the need for 5+ subscriptions to watch the shows I want to watch. The infamous legal Pokemon streaming guide comes to mind. I don't wish for anyone to have to navigate the legal streaming realm. And I am the first person to advocate for piracy, but I do understand the convinience behind paying for streaming and that the average person doesn't view piracy as moral. To that I say you need to shake the fear of the pre-movie FBI anti-piracy notices. It will all be okay. Buy a 500GB portable SSD and <s>nyaa.si</s> to your hearts content.

</figure>
					</p>
					<p>Luckily, HiDive and... Disney and Hulu... and others are keeping the ecosystem from falling into the greedy hands of Sony. You might have seen anime commentators talking about CR's current subtitling dilemma, but if you haven't, the gist is that instead of paying for captioners and using the highly customizable and industry standard AegiSub, a program that has been around and used by companies and freelancers since the beginning of time, they are migrating to a far less versatile AI captioning company based in Israel. How many red flags do we need. You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-DX0Zolr6g">Geoff's more in-depth breakdown</a>(which will touch on stuff I've talked about here), but it raises not only a worse viewing experience, but also accessibilty issues and, due to the AI usage, environmental and ethical concerns that I just can't get into here, and, obviously, there's the elephant in the room.</p>
					<p>Even the piracy ecosystem is potentially going to be impacted very soon. Kadokawa and other big industry names just <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/information/news_release/2025111901_en.html">won a lawsuit</a> against Cloudflare for copyright infringement because of piracy sites that were hosted via Cloudflare's services. Now. I have big feelings about this. Much like many others, I became such a big anime fan with no small assistance from KissAnime (and all her totally not legit and safe copycats). I watched so many bad yaoi anime over Skype with my friends during our middle school days, but also shows like Black Butler, Tokyo Ghoul, and... sigh... Hetalia... but the point is that my formative years of being an anime fan with no debit card and minimal income was because of piracy sites. The same goes for the manga side of it. Scanlation groups were and are the backbone of the manga community. Hell, just within the past year we saw Love Bullet go from nearly being cancelled to selling out at Kinokuniyas across the English-speaking sphere, all thanks to people scanning and translating, and hosting it on piracy sites. <strong> Scanlations are free advertising for these big corporations.</strong> And without them, you can expect a sharp increase in unfortunate mangaka facing cancellation and a sharp decrease in profits for these corporations because there is no way for overseas fans to read works that appeal to them, and keep them from discovering and supporting up and coming mangaka. Not even mentioning old manga that just never received any official translation and are only able to be enjoyed on these sites. Kadokawa and others are shooting themselves in the foot by doing this. I like using piracy as a test run for a lot of things. If I enjoy something enough, I probably will end up buying it at some point. I've done it countless times with games, anime, and manga. With the prices of everything right now, I'm not buying a $12-$16 manga volume for it to sit at the back of my bookshelf forever. That is valuable Wawa hoagie and a drink money. I do use the Shonen Jump and Manga Plus apps</p>

                    <code>♬⋆.˚<b> listening to...</b> this is love - self</code>
                    <p>As always, October was... a month (spooky style). Anyways!</p>
                    <h4>✩ My Filofax</h4>
                    <p>I finally revamped how I journal with my filofax, as mentioned in a previous blog post :33 and I've
                        been having so much more fun and ease using it so much. Unfortunately I've gotten
                        so attached to it that I've sometimes abandoned my daily tasks to make it prettier lol.
                        I think with more use the novelty of it will go away and I'll utilize it in a more practical way.
                        I also added scrap pieces of paper I use to take notes that are useful and that I wanna refer 
                        back to later. I think having them originally in my catch all notebook felt like they weren't as
                        important, but putting them in my filofax actually gives it that significance yk...</p>
                    <h4>✩ Splatterpunk/extreme horror books</h4>
                    <p>Kind of an unexpected thing? But it's Halloween season so not really
                        but anyways. I just recently (shocking) discovered this genre of books after
                        getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozoXHclW2Bc" target="_blank">this video</a>
                        in my recommended. I heard about 'Playground' by Aron Beauregard some years ago,
                        but I never even knew this was under some genre called extreme horror, and I never
                        really delved into the book anyways because the synopsis didn't sound like
                        something I'd enjoy. But after this vid I just said Fuck it
                        and I decided to read 'Grandpappy' by Patrick C. Harrison III first because why not.</p>
                    <p>And I guess. That happened? I don't even know where to begin or end but I barely even
                        read the synopsis or did any deeper investigating into this book, I just went in
                        headfirst <span class="spoiler">(as did Charles)</span> and read through this book during 
                        my shift. There were exactly 2 times where I just read a half of a sentence knowing
                        where the second half was going and I just had to put my phone down and cover my
                        o-face of shock for a solid minute,,  I really can't give these books a rating
                        because in my mind it fluctuates
                        so much, but it was really a Read and a book I will most definitely remember
                        for better or for worse as being my first intro into splatterpunk.
                        Truly such a fucking wild ride, when I thought that it couldn't get any worse
                        or weirder it just kept piling and piling up like some disgusting pile, but I 
                        could not turn away. I really don't want to say anything about this book since I
                        experienced it best going in blind, but yeah just a heads up that there's probably
                        every possible thing you would need to include a trigger warning for in this book.
                        Please stay safe dude</p>
                    <p>And following the PCH3 train, I read '100% Match' next. This one fell a bit flat to me
                        after reading the trip that was Grandpappy, it's about a very weird guy who does
                        incredibly weird and disgusting awful things and he's also a burger flipper at 
                        a fast food place. The random acts of violence he does throughout the story don't
                        make much of an impact for me besides just being there to shock (which i guess
                        that's what the whole genre is about so I got what I signed up for), but idk. The most insane line to me was the one 
                        in the chapter 'The Visitor'—you know, the one where he sends an email to his
                        senator and puts his finger somewhere where he shouldn't. Free will is a thing.
                        <span class="spoiler">And I guess hooray gender equality?</span></p>
                    <p>But idk! Maybe I'll read the more of this genre, maybe not. I've heard that
                        transgressive fiction is another genre that gets into taboo subjects
                        but with more nuance. I know Kristopher Triana's 'Gone to See the River Man' is said
                        to fall in that category, but my library didn't have that book,, But it did have 
                        'That Night in the Woods,' which had me thoroughly invested truly, I read through like 100
                        pages each night before bed lolfhsd it really keeps you waiting for wtf will happen..
                        The ending was kind of not what I had expected but I guess that happened.
                        If I can find a used copy of 'Gone to See the River Man' I will most definitely get it because
                        I enjoy his writing style very much.</p>
                    <h4>✩ Ethical hacking</h4>
                    <img src="blog/2025/251029/251029.png" alt="title: kali linux user. what i think i do: image of a wizard
                    on a huge epic dragon. what my parents think i do: image of a cartoon burglar. what arch users
                    think i do: image of a baby crying. what i actually do: image of the hackthebox logo and a woman
                    screaming at their laptop with their hands on their head in frustration." style="float:right; height:200px;margin-top: 5px;">
                    <p>I didn't really have a choice in this because it was for school but this seriously felt
                        like I was little kid and some giant adult just pushed me into the deepest end of the 
                        pool without so much as a 'Good luck' but I mean I can't lie that I've learned an insane
                        amount of information having to rawdog hacking. I underestimated this class so much lmfaosdjf
                        it's my fault really but whatever.It's actually something I wanna learn (even if it feels like
                        90% of the time I'm doing it out of spite) because once you get past the fact that you have
                        to sit for hours at a time creating half terabyte-long wordlists to decrypt like 4
                        passwords or losing your eyesight reading through an image's hex you actually feel a sense of
                        accomplishment. idk don't listen to me I'm still a huge fcking noob compared to hackers that
                        exist in the world but at least i was in the top 3 performers of my class in the ncl individual
                        game... my potential is defrosting perhaps, I'm also thinking of adding like a sort
                        of wiki/resource page on my site for all the sites and shit I use to help me while
                        I do these ctf challenges</p>
                    <p></p>                    
                    <h4>✩ Music from the month</h4>
                    <p>Honestly didn't listen to much music because I had so much homework to do,
                        but the songs I listened to were always on repeat (e.g. Pinkpantheress, Luis
                        Miguel, Self), I also went through my autumn playlist on foobar which was nice
                        for lighter study sessions and general internet browsing
                    </p>
                    <img src="blog/2025/251029/251029_1.png" style="height:450px;">
                    <p>The highlight of the month for me tho was definitely 'Fancy That'...
                        I've wanted to listen to Pinkpantheress' new mixtape for months now and I'm so
                        glad I finally got the time... It's so fcuking catchy and has everything that I love
                        in music, I didn't think anything could top Tonight but then the transition
                        into Stars made me change my find soooo fast lawl and Yves collabing with Pink
                        on the alt ver of this song, soooo iconic</p>
                    <p>Odd Eye Circle also released their solos this month!!! Personally I would rank them
                        as: Pressure - Choerry(!!!!) &gt; Can You Entertain? - Kim Lip &gt; Ring of Chaos - Jinsoul,
                        but all of them are super 
                        fcking well made, I'm so glad ARTMS are releasing solos recently... special shoutout
                        to Choerry for saving music, listening to her solo just made me replay her copypasta
                        in my mind..
                        <span class="spoiler"> <b>"CHOERRY ISN’T JUST A STAR. She’s the brightest star that
                            lights up the universe. The baddest woman that has ever walked on earth she's
                            on her own league she didn’t come to take part she came to take over. She is
                            Choerry remember her name. Choerry the best!"</b></span></p>
                        <p>Yves also released her new song Ex Machina with such a good music
                        video to accompany it, I've seen lots of theories going around wondering the about
                        the meaning behind it. Yves is truly in her own league with how unique her
                        artistic view is and I hope she keeps going up and up she deserves all the attention and fame :333 </p>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>Me rn because I'm just fucking done with everything</p>
                    <p>Consuming every single fucking second of the week
                        makes me want to reject all modernity and leave everything I've known behind, but of
                        course that's beyond impossible in this world. I need to show myself more love,
                        in the form of discipline and setting boundaries for my behaviors because sometime
                        in the future, I'll think back and wonder why I wasted my time on mindless
                        frivolous content, instead of doing activities and creating in ways that
                        would improve myself and make my genuinely feel good.</p>
                    <p>I think I've gotten to that age where I'm realizing that life is
                        life and I can't keep wasting it on mindless content. Similar to how when you
                        lose interest in an interest, everytime I reactivate or log into a mainstream
                        social media account, now I just feel Nothing towards it. Complete apathy, which
                        makes me ask "Why do I keep doing this." Maybe in the near future I'll completely
                        delete my social media accounts for good. </p>
                    <p>I'm trying to analyze why I reach for my phone so much in the first place. I ask myself
                        some of these questions to make me think twice about reaching for my phone:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why do I reach for my phone?</li>
                        <li>what do I feel when I use my phone? (divide into positive/negative feelings)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do the positive feelings lead to negative feelings later? ex. opening up
                                a social media app to get a dopamine hit, but then I feel bad when I lose my
                                time scrolling through it</li>
                            <li>Do the negative feelings lead to positive feelings? ex. feeling antsy when I
                                wanna go on youtube, but then I do something more productive and feel glad that
                                I didn't give into the temptation initially</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Is it necessary that I reach for my phone at this moment?</li>
                        <li>What could I do instead of reaching for my phone?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How do I feel after doing something else instead of looking at my phone?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p>....Anyways. I've updated my journaling system!! I've wanted to find a more streamlined
                        method of journaling that is fun as a hobby, while also making sure it serves a 
                        positive purpose while not overcomplicating and making me overthink everything. My
                        mini catch-all has been migrated to my filofax, where I cut old unused grid
                        paper to fit into my pocket planner. I also made a crafty section where I tape sticky
                        note stacks onto a thicker piece of paper, in addition to using old sticker paper
                        and parchment paper to stick a lot of my unused stickers I had
                        lying around (i wanted to get a proper sticker journal but realized that would be adding
                        a whole new journal into my ecosystem which I don't need xd). I'm also just using it as a
                        general notes section like when I'm watching a movie/show/anything and I see concepts,
                        words, or actions that I'd like to refer back to.</p>
                    <p>I also migrated my daily gratitude and songs tracking to my diary, it removes that limit of
                        smaller paper from the pocket filofax. I also felt like I had an
                        obligation to keep writing these dailys in my filofax, but I just felt burnt
                        out by it for some reason. My diary feels a lot easier for me to pick up because
                        it's not really supposed to be pretty, and I can expand on the good events or
                        why something went wrong one day. </p>
                    <p>I've also been trying to find a balance between digital and analog tracking.
                        I deleted my Hardcover account which really felt like it wasn't
                        providing anything to me since I don't really read a lot of physical books (/sad)
                        and i like tracking books physically tbh. I don't know if I could
                        delete my letterboxd account since I'm always watching movies, and I already have
                        all my history of movies watched that I wouldn't know how to migrate. I'm not really into
                        the whole social media aspect of it anyways, I just like keeping track of all my movies, so
                        I feel like it serves a purpose of a movie tracker fine digitally.</p>
                    <p>I'm really tired lol I can barely move my hands right now </p>

                    <p>I have this Thinkpad T480 I got secondhand about a year ago ish to help me practice 
                    linux and dual boot with windows for school stuff lol.. ngl I was influenced by the r/thinkpad
                    circlejerkers /j to get this model but it's been pretty good overall, the keys are kinda heavy
                    but it's not the end of the world bc it's functional, and with the minimal upgrades I gave it
                    it's been dependable as some thinkpads are known to be. 
                    since then, the only main problem has been that there's a 75% chance of whenever I restart
                    that it'll show a "Fan error" message before booting into the OS and immediately shut off.
                    I've read online that you can actually bypass this by clicking Esc but I never tried that
                    lol because the beep it makes during this error is like an emergency alert system alarm
                    that drives me away so fucking fast lawl</p>
                    <p>I've been putting off even opening this laptop, I said I'd do it a week after first
                    getting it but that's been forever ago lol, the most I've done since then is
                    buying a 72wh external battery for it. I know some people have opinions on whether to get
                    this big of a battery for this model, but personally for me I think it's been pretty
                    okay for me. Since this is a secondhand laptop, getting a battery upgrade was pretty much
                    a given for me, and I went with this aftermarket external battery that, in combination with
                    the <s>pretty shit</s> internal battery, gets me decent hours when I'm doing idle work and
                    also when I need my webcam turned on for long periods of time.</p>
                    <p>But just on a whim a few days ago I opened it up and finally changed the thermal
                    paste on the CPU (it was dry as hell), which also meant disconnecting and reconnecting the
                    fan to do all this stuff. I turned it back on and it was all good, tried restarting and it
                    didn't give a fan error this time. Could just be one of those 25% chances where nothing happens,
                    but we'll see with more uses if all it needed was the oldest trick in the book of unplugging
                    and plugging it back in lol... if I still get this error I'll probably look into buying a new
                    fan for it, maybe if I'm up for it I'll see what I can do about getting a dual pipe
                    heatsink since I've heard it helps with overall temps too</p>

                    <p>September was A Month... as all months are. I've been trying to keep up with
                        classes but I took on a lot and it's soooo exhausting sometimes along with work.
                        I have to be extra mindful with my free time and my hobbies, and I'm really making
                        efforts to cut down on useless screentime and replacing it with off-screen hobbies
                        like reading or journaling. Segue...</p>
                    <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1709520121i/205804236.jpg" style="float: right;">                        
                    <h4>✩ Make Me a Mixtape - Jennifer Whiteford</h4>
                    <p>I saw the autumn-y cover and just had to get it at the library to prepare for 
                        fall... Overall I would give it a 3.5/5. It was an entertaining read, and Allie
                        &amp; Ryan were super sweet when they got together. It kinda dragged on at times, and
                        I wished there was a bit more autumn/winter descriptions but it was very nice
                         and I literally cried when <span class="spoiler">  Allie and Jessi
                            reunited ;; so adorable i wish we could've seen more of them overall in the 
                            story!! i cri.</span>  but overall an enjoyable read! I'd recommend if you love 
                            references to pop and rock classics and not so friends to friends to lovers.</p>
                    <h4>✩ Study timers and screen trackers</h4>
                    <p>Both are together because they kinda serve similar purposes to me. I specifically
                        use <a href="https://studo.space/free/" target="_blank">studo</a> as a study timer in 35 or 70 minute
                        increments while I study. Having this pulled up on the side while I work is good at
                        keeping track of my study time, and since it stops taking time when you exit the tab,
                        you literally <em>have</em> to keep it open so you study.</p>
                    <p>I also use the built-in screen tracker on Samsung on my lock screen as a widget.
                        This means that everytime I open my phone I see how long I've been using it in 
                        the day and if I want to contribute to adding more of that screentime. Sometimes
                        it actually is necessary for me to open my phone, like if I have a work or school
                        text, but overall I've been keeping my screentime under 5 hours these days, sometimes
                        3-4 hours on a good day. I know that sounds like a lot but before I'd have 8-9 hour
                        avg screen times lollll so baby steps for now at least. </p>

                    <h4>✩ Music from the month</h4>
                        <p>And a topsters of my top songs from the last 30 days from lastfm... it's not 
                            included but I am suuuuper obsessed with the found lost media that is 
                            sElf's cover of 'Sugar, Sugar' bc it is just soooo catchy... </p>
                        <img src="/blog/2025/250928/250928_4.png" style="height:400px;">
                        <p>And out of all of these, of course I listened to Man's Best Friend the most.
                            And i really honestly like this album better than Short n' Sweet TO MEEEE.
                            Because idk there area a lot more catchier songs here to
                            me, and they're all just so fun to listen to. Go Go Juice is probably my top
                            song off the album now that it's been a month of listening, but I remember I 
                            was sooo obsessed with Tears when I first listened to it (I still love it tbh).
                            Goodbye is also such a highlight to me, the ABBA-isms tickle my brain so much. 
                            And i'm so bitter that Such a Funny Way wasn't included in the main album, it's
                            probably one of my favorite songs from here, I am such a sucker for tempo 
                            changes.... My Man on Willpower is probably the only song I don't really vibe
                            with but other than that, the album is literally no skip To Me.</p>
                        <p>If i had to rank all the songs... 
                            </p><ol>

                        <p>like lots of other ppl i love when the weather turns cold and i can listen to
                            my favorite black metal albums for that crispy cold atmosphere...                         there's some great atmospheric black metal albums specifically that fit the
                            autumn mood perfectly :] I've made playlists of songs for both autumn atmospheric black metal
                            and autumn metal/rock that fit the vibe of autumn To Me. idk these songs just
                            eminate a chilliness with that warm color of autumn in them</p>

                    <p>Aaaaand that's it!!! Unrelated but I redownloaded overwatch for a hot second and
                        literally almost fell back into that addiction, I had to uninstall it because I 
                        got out of control so fast i needed to fucking stoppppp... at least till i 
                        have it more under control. Maybe i'll make a blog post later detailing how I'm trying 
                        to do so with that and screentime overall
